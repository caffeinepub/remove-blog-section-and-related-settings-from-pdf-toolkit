# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename all user-visible in-app branding from “PDF Toolkit” to “PDF Vaulty”.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the document/page title to display “PDF Vaulty”.
- Update header/nav brand text to “PDF Vaulty” and set the logo image alt text to “PDF Vaulty”.
- Update homepage hero copy so any “PDF Toolkit” text becomes “PDF Vaulty”.
- Update English i18n strings that contain “PDF Toolkit” to “PDF Vaulty”, preserving existing translation key structure.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see “PDF Vaulty” consistently across the browser tab title, header branding, and homepage hero text, with no remaining “PDF Toolkit” strings in the English UI.

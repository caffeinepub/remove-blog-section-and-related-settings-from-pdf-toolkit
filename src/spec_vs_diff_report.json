  "summary": "The diff implements most of the PowerPoint to PDF conversion feature. All 6 requirements have corresponding code changes. However, REQ-6 (adding the PowerPoint to PDF link to HomePage.tsx) is missing from the diff, and the PowerPoint conversion utility (REQ-2) is incomplete as it throws a 'not yet available' error instead of performing actual conversion.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Add a PowerPoint to PDF link to the homepage tool grid at frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx, positioned logically among other conversion tools with appropriate icon and description",
      "reason": "The diff shows modifications to HomePage.tsx in the file summary, but the actual content is truncated and does not show the PowerPoint to PDF card being added to the tools grid",

        "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx"

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Create a utility function frontend/src/utils/powerPointToPdf.ts that converts PowerPoint files to PDF format with actual conversion logic",
      "reason": "The convertPowerPointToPdf function throws an error stating 'PowerPoint to PDF conversion is not yet available. This feature requires server-side processing' instead of performing the conversion. The BuildRequest explicitly states 'Use only frontend-based conversion' and the function should follow the same patterns as excelToPdf.ts and wordToPdf.ts",
